****GITHUB INDIAN USERS DEEP DATA ANALYSIS****

**Project Overview:**
India has one of the fastest-growing developer communities on GitHub, contributing significantly to open-source projects, software innovation, and industry growth. This project aims to analyze the behavior, activity, and engagement trends of Indian GitHub users, providing valuable insights into their programming language preferences, repository contributions, collaboration patterns, and hiring trends . By leveraging data analytics and visualization, this study helps businesses, educators, and policymakers understand India's evolving developer ecosystem, identify key trends, and make informed decisions. Through interactive dashboards and deep insights, we uncover the impact of Indian developers on the global open-source landscape.
