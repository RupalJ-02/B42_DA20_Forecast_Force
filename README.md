**Project Overview:**
India has one of the fastest-growing developer communities on GitHub, contributing significantly to open-source projects, software innovation, and industry growth. This project aims to analyze the behavior, activity, and engagement trends of Indian GitHub users, providing valuable insights into their programming language preferences, repository contributions, collaboration patterns, and hiring trends . By leveraging data analytics and visualization, this study helps businesses, educators, and policymakers understand India's evolving developer ecosystem, identify key trends, and make informed decisions. Through interactive dashboards and deep insights, we uncover the impact of Indian developers on the global open-source landscape. 

**Scope of the Project:**
1. User Demographics – Examining location, education, and company affiliations of Indian GitHub users.
2. Programming Language Trends – Identifying the most widely used and emerging languages.
3. Repository Activity Analysis – Tracking commits, forks, stars, and contributions to assess engagement.
4. Top Contributors & Influencers – Recognizing highly active developers and their impact on open-source.
5. Industry & Hiring Insights – Understanding which companies hire GitHub contributors and the skills in demand.
6. Interactive Dashboard Development – Creating real-time visualizations to explore insights
